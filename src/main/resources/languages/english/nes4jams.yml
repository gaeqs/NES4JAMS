NES4JAMS_DESCRIPTION: NES developing environment for JAMS.
NES4JAMS_PROJECT_TEMPLATE_NES_EMPTY: Empty NES project.

NES4JAMS_BAR_SPRITES_TO_ASSEMBLE: Sprites to assemble
NES4JAMS_BAR_PPU: PPU
NES4JAMS_BAR_INFO: Simulation info

NUMBER_FORMAT_NES_COLOR: Color (NES)
NUMBER_FORMAT_SHORT: Short
NUMBER_FORMAT_HEXADECIMAL_SHORT: Hexadecimal short

NES4JAMS_MEMORY_BANK_START: 'Start:'
NES4JAMS_MEMORY_BANK_SIZE: 'Size:'
NES4JAMS_MEMORY_BANK_WRITABLE: 'Writable:'
NES4JAMS_MEMORY_BANK_WRITE_ON_CARTRIDGE: 'In cartridge:'

NES4JAMS_TASK_LOADING_CARTRIDGE: Loading cartridge...

NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MEMORY_BANKS: 'Memory banks:'
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MEMORY_BANKS_TOOLTIP: |-
  The memory banks are used by the assembler to store the data into the ROM. 
  You can change between banks in your code using the directive .bank. 
  At least one memory bank is required for the assembler to work.
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MIRRORING: 'Mirroring:'
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MIRRORING_TOOLTIP: |-
  This field sets the nametable mirroring of the game. 
  When mirroring is enabled for a particular axis, the coordinates wrap arround on the current nametable.
  This value may be overriden by the cartridge mapper.
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_TV_TYPE: 'TV type:'
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_TV_TYPE_TOOLTIP: |-
  Sets the TV type this game runs on. This value is equivalent to the region of the game. There are three tv types:
  NTSC: valid for North America, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan NES / Famicon devices. Game runs at 1789773 Hz.
  PAL: valid for Western Europe and Australia NES devices. Game runs at 1662607 Hz.
  DENDY: NES clone popular in Easter Europe, Russia, Mainland China, India and Africa. Game runs at 1773448 Hz.
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_CONSOLE_TYPE: 'Console type:'
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_CONSOLE_TYPE_TOOLTIP: |-
  There are some systems based on the NES hardware able to run special versions of NES games.
  There are two official modifications of this kind: the Nintendo VS. and the PlayChoice-10, both arcade boards.
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MAPPER: 'Mapper:'
NES4JAMS_SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION_MAPPER_TOOLTIP: |-
  Mappers are hardware inside a cartridge designed to extend the system and bypass the NES limitations.
  They allow a game to have extra RAM, can create custom interrupts or can simply extend the cartridge ROM using registers to change between memory banks.
